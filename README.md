# plasmid-design-with-ori-detection_BBL434
This project designs a plasmid that works in an unknown organism by first detecting the organism-specific origin of replication using GC skew analysis.  The detected ORI is used as the replication backbone, ensuring host compatibility. Replication genes are added by default as required by the referenced paper.
